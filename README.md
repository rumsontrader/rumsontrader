### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently working on building a thermostat with an ESP32 and DHT22 sensor wired into an extension cord to control a small electric heater in my shed. I want to be able to read the temperature via WiFi on my iphone and be able to adjust the temperature I want the heater to run at. And, I will try to also create historical data that I can send to a databse or excel spreadsheet to track the temperature and the amount of time the heater runs. There are 3 settings on my heater so I want to compare which setting is more efficient. 

Any advise or help with my code is appreciated!

Have a GREAT day!!ðŸ˜Ž
